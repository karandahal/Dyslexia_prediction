The inputtest.ipynb shows how the inputs work to come out with the prediction(High, Moderate, Low) which will not be shown in the app.py website (this one is also included in the details file)

The file Dyslexia_test_questions set.docx is the test that we created (we collected some formulas and data from several well-known sources)
