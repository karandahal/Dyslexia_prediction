# Dyslexia_prediction

This is a project for predicting dyslexia disease with interface using streamlit

Source of Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thenikhilnj45/dyslexiaproject

The Details_dyslexia.ipynb is our final version that include everything

The data_preprocessing_model_training.ipynb shows only the Data Preprocessing and Model Training of the Random Forest with GridSearch CV(this one is also included in the details file)

The inputtest.ipynb shows how the inputs work to come out with the prediction(High, Moderate, Low) which will not be shown in the app.py website (this one is also included in the details file)

The file Dyslexia_test_questions set.docx is the test that we created (we collected some formulas and data from several well-known sources)

Instruction for how to run the app:

For mac-user, you should use app_mac_ver.py

For window-user, you should use app.py

Putting model.pkl and scaler.pkl and questions_vocab.json in the same directory as app.py ( or app_mac_ver.py)

For the audio part, you should download the Audios_memory to execute audio question
